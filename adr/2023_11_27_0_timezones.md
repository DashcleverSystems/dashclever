- Everything in the database is timezone agnostic. All date and time manipulations on the backend are also timezone agnostic.
- Timezone agnostic means processing date and time as it is a GMT/UTC +0.

If you need to display some date and time in timezone relative manner It must be done in the backend presentation layer (eg: Controller in rest api)
